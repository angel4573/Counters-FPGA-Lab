# Counters-FPGA-Lab

## Introduction
The goal of this lab is to create and test diffrent VHDL counter codes with a Zybo Z7-20 board to flash LEDs according to the counter being implemented. The counters include a ring counter, binary counter, fibonacci counter, and johnson counter. The switches on the Zybo board will control which counter that will be used for flashing the LEDS. In addtion a clock divider program is also developed to slow down the ouput frequncy of the Zybo board from 125Mhz to 1Hz with 50% duty cycle.
